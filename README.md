## Getting Started
You can clone this repository with git clone <url> and utilize it for your own needs. For example, if you want to clone this repository do the following commands:
  
  
> `$ git clone https://github.com/brandonrost/ProjectOne.git`
> 
> This creates a directory named ProjectOne, initializes a .git directory inside it, pulls down all the data for that repository, and checks out a working copy of the latest version. If you go into the new ProjectOne directory that was just created, youâ€™ll see the project files in there, ready to be worked on or used.

> If you want to clone the repository into a directory named something other than ProjectOne, you can specify the new directory name as an additional argument:
> 
> `$ git clone  https://github.com/brandonrost/ProjectOne.git newProject`
> 
> That command does the same thing as the previous one, but the target directory is called newProject.

- After you have cloned the repository, youll have to configure a database for the application to map to. 
- Next, set the Hibernate `mode` to 'create'
- Once you have done the above two steps, run your application
- Now that you have "created" your database tables, set the Hibernate `mode` to `validate`
- From now on, you should be able to run the application without changing hibernate mode 
   
## Usage
  
> Users should utilize this application as a bare-bones reimbursement system that may be used to track and change current and past reimbursements that Employees have submitted, and Finance Managers have the ability to change. The users (employees and finance managers, alike) should use this application to register, login, and view current and past reimbursements. Below are some pictures to help you get started.
